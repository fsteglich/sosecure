A capture the flag VM for IT security professionals (not easy)

Download the VM from the releases tab, import it into Virtual Box and run it. Then connect to the server using the IP printed on boot and try to get code execution and (after a few steps) even root rights. At the end, you should find a proof.txt file (you will know which one).

You might want to adjust the network interface of the VM to your needs.

Please do not attempt physical attacks on the system (like mounting the disk on a different system and reading its content) if you do not want to spoil yourself. Instead, assume that it's a server out of your control and compromise it using network attacks only.

This challenge is considered hard and was created for experienced IT professionals (or 1337 hackers or whatever they are called nowadays). If you considered OSCP too easy and too artificial, this might be interesting for you. But bring time for you really need to try harder. However, if you exhausted your options or really want to know if your on the right track, you can contact me for help (but I might need while to answer).

The current release of the VM is a bit older and might be vulnerable to a few newer attacks that I did not intend it to be vulnerable to. Once your finished you should update the OS and all installed packets and retry (or maybe by then you know what kinds of attacks I consider fair game). Maybe I will upload a newer build and sources some time.

If you enjoyed the thing, please send me a mail and tell me about it.
